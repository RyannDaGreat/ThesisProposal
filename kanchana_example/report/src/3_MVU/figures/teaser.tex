    \caption[Overview of MVU Framework]{\textbf{Overview of Framework:}
    We propose three variants of our framework that solves complex long-video question-answering tasks.
    (left-top) \llmbaseline utilizes only world knowledge with zero task-specific awareness. 
    (left-bottom)
    \vlmbaseline processes an additional center frame to obtain task context but accesses no \textit{video} specific information. 
    (right) Our complete approach, MVU extracts three additional object-centric information modalities followed by fusion in language space. LS refers to likelihood selection.
