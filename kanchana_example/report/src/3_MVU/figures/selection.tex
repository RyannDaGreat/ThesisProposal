    \caption[Likelihood Selection Workflow]{\textbf{Likelihood Selection Workflow:} 
    We illustrate how the likelihood selection strategy adapted for video QnA tasks can be efficiently parallelized (i.e. calculated with a simple cross-entropy loss in one forward pass, followed by an argmin operation), in contrast to the setting of iteratively generating multiple tokens.
