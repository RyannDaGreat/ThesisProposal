    \textbf{LangToMo Architecture:}
    (Left) Diffusion model generates pixel motion conditioned on RGB image, prior motion, and caption. Visualized predictions are overlaid as arrows. 
    (Right) ViT-T network maps predicted motion to robot actions in supervised setting, conditioned on initial/current states and target motion.
