\caption[Extended Results on Real World Environment]{
    \textbf{Extended Results on Real World Environment:} 
    We evaluate the impact of using human demonstrations (HD) in addition to robot demonstrations (RD) as training data for our System 2 diffusion model. The standard setting following prior work is training on RD. AVDC trained on RD is provided as a baseline. Results indicate that training our method on HD alone performs reasonably, while using HD along with RD fortraining boosts performance further. RD here refers to human controlled robot demonstrations while HD refers to human controlled human demonstrations (e.g. human using their own human hand to move an object) See \Cref{ltm_app_fig:demos} for examples.
