\section{Alpha Matting and Synthetic Dataset Generation}
\label{magick_sec:relatedwork}

\textbf{Synthetic Segmentation Data Generation:} Early methods utilize GANs for data synthesis: DatasetGAN~\cite{zhang2021datasetgan} decodes GAN latent codes to generate segmentation data for specific object parts, and BigDatasetGAN~\cite{zhang2022bigdatasetgan} produces masks for single objects trained on ImageNet~\cite{ILSVRC15}. Diffusion-based methods take a text prompt and synthesize an image along with a mask, either for single objects~\cite{wu2023diffumask,li2023open} or semantic segmentations~\cite{wu2023datasetdm,nguyen2023dataset}, with variations generating multiple objects~\cite{xie2023mosaicfusion} or masks before images~\cite{ye2023seggen}. Peekaboo~\cite{burgert2023peekaboo} generates single objects but lacks fine details like hair and fur. While concerns exist about training on generated data~\cite{alemohammad2023selfconsuming,shumailov2023curse}, these works show that synthetic data yields results on par with or surpassing real-data baselines. A shared drawback is that all focus on binary masks. Our method specifically targets generating images with alpha mattes that exhibit fine boundary details and transparencies.

\textbf{Alpha Matting Datasets:} Existing alpha matting datasets are small due to the difficulty of obtaining ground-truth alpha. The alphamatting.com dataset~\cite{rhemann2009perceptually} used triangulation matting to produce only 27 training images, later extended to video via stop-motion photography~\cite{erofeev2015perceptually}. Manual extraction using matting methods has produced several datasets~\cite{xu2017deep,shen2016deep,wang2021crgnn,sun2021semantic}, but the process is time-consuming and error-prone, yielding only a few hundred objects. Video matting datasets use chroma keying~\cite{smith1996blue,zhang2021attention,lin2021real}, but require careful physical setup and manual post-processing. In contrast, our approach produces large numbers of accurate alpha mattes with minimal user interaction.

\textbf{Segmentation and Matting:} An alternative would be extracting objects from generated images using standard segmentation or matting methods. While many segmentation datasets~\cite{lin2014microsoft,zhou2017scene,OpenImages,Cordts2016Cityscapes} and methods for salient object segmentation~\cite{li2014secrets,li2017instance,qin2022highly,kirillov2019panoptic} exist, these do not yield accurate alpha mattes. Matting methods~\cite{xu2017deep,soumyadip2020background,cai2019disentangled,lu2019indices,dai2022boosting}, despite recent progress, remain imperfect and would introduce errors or artifacts.
