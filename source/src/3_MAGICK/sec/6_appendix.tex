\section{User Interface}

As a followup to \cref{sub:image_selection_process}, we discuss a specialized user interface we have developed for the manual annotation of this dataset, dramatically reducing the effort, time and cost of doing so.

Manual annotation, though less expensive than manual image matting (costing around \$30,000 and a few months), remains costly and time-consuming. To streamline this process, we've developed web-based program specifically for the task of selecting the best matte for subjects.

Along with the dataset, this tool will also be released to the public domain - in order to help people view and interact with this dataset before downloading it, as well as allowing people to easily expand it later on.

This tool simplifies the task by enabling annotators to quickly choose the best image from a set by simply clicking on it \cref{fig:ui}. Because it is web-based, it allows easy distribution of the annotation task: instead of having workers download the images to their local machines, terabytes of data can be streamed as they need it. Some key UI features include easy background color switching, alpha mask viewing with a single key-press, and workload distribution among multiple workers for parallel processing. 

Annotators are required to work with a dataset comprising RGBA images, which poses a challenge since there are no RGBA monitors — all physical pixels on a screen possess only RGB values. To circumvent this, we enable users to quickly view the alpha channel for samples and alternate the background color. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how the alpha mask influences the images.


% When the user's mouse is hovered over an image and the space bar is pressed, it zooms to full-screen. And when the letter `a' is pressed, it shows the alpha mask for that sample. This is better than zooming in manually to each sample, saving time and thus reducing the cost of annotation. There are many such quality of life features included like this.

This UI also includes search functionality as well, letting users search for images based on their captions. In \cref{fig:ui}, you can see that in the caption ``A crystal clear icicle hanging from a frozen branch'', the word ``icicle'' is bold and glowing - indicating the search term that matches that caption. There, the search term was ``icicle''. And in \cref{fig:tagging}, the search term ``letter'' was used.

Users can also tag images with tags such as ``\#nsfw,'' ``bad,'' and several other optional custom tags. Tags have many use cases, including: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It allows for the explicit annotation of poorly generated samples that lack good matting. Although this is a rare case, it still needs to be addressed.
    \item It enables the categorization of samples. For instance, the ``\#nsfw'' tag, represented as a button below the image samples, when activated for a given sample, marks that sample as not safe for work.
    \item It permits marking samples as ``\#idk'', which indicates that the sample requires review by another annotator. Since tags are searchable, if the user searches ``\#idk'', all samples marked as such will appear and can be reviewed.
\end{enumerate}


A live server for our dataset, along with the code and a user manual will be released for free to the public along with this paper. We hope by doing so we can encourage others to help grow the manually annotated portion of this dataset further.




\section{Additional Dataset Statistics}
Our data-set contains both safe-for-work and NSFW content, which is labeled as such. Approximately $.15\%$ of the samples in our dataset are flagged NSFW, as determined by a combination of the human annotators and a check for over 3000 blacklisted keywords present in the subjects. 

Additionally, the dataset contains a mix of shadows and non-shadows - as some samples will include soft shadows in their alpha-matte. 

The whole dataset generation process was accomplished on 32 A100 GPUs over the span of three weeks, plus an additional two months of human annotation with a budget of \$30000 USD. 

As mentioned in \cref{sub:least_common_hue},
green and blue are the most common hues in our dataset. The exact distribution is shown in \cref{fig:leastCommonHueDistribution}.

\section{User Study Details}
As mentioned in \cref{sec:application_alpha_to_rgb}, we provide all images used in our user study in this supplementary material, in \cref{fig:userstudy_full} - a continuation of \cref{fig:user_results}.


\section{Selecting Prompts (Continued)}
In \cref{sub:selecting_prompts} we listed three methods of generating prompts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item LLM-Generated Prompts
    \item Procedurally Generated Prompts
    \item Image Captions
\end{enumerate}


In this section we will give examples for each category.


\subsection{LLM-Generated Prompts} 

What we send to GPT4:

\lstset{
    basicstyle=\promptExampleSize\ttfamily,
    breaklines=true,
    % postbreak=\mbox{\textcolor{red}{$\hookrightarrow$}\space},
}

\begin{lstlisting}
We are generating a large synthetic dataset of images with complex alpha mattes.
Please generate a list of image prompts with the following themes:
[water, fire, feathers, hair, glass, humans, animals] + any other themes with complex alpha mattes
DO NOT describe entire scenes, and DO NOT specify backgrounds - declare ONLY a single well-described isolated foreground subject.
The output format should be a code block with at least 500 line-separated prompts.
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Matting Experiments}
% \heading{Reviewers N9yT, eZzn: } \question{Using MAGICK to train matting models.}
% \phantomsection %This might let the label work..
% \label{sec:matting} %This doesn't work - I don't think you can add a label to something that's not a figure or section can you? The current compilation results in ?? --- I'll try something
 We trained a matting model from Dai et al, CVPR 2023 [7] under default settings on various training sets - comprised of images from both the MAGICK dataset and the Deep Image Matting (DIM) dataset. The ratio of datasets used varied; for example, a 1/3 ratio means 1/3 of the training images were from MAGICK, and 2/3 from DIM. Our results are in \cref{fig:matting}.

We evaluated the models on the DIM test set using the standard metrics. Our findings showed that a combined dataset approach yielded better results than using either the MAGICK or DIM datasets alone. The optimal performance was achieved with a mixture where 1/5 of the data was from MAGICK and 4/5 from DIM. %\todo{Do we have to explain what each metric - aka MSE, SAD, Conn and Grad mean? It's in the other paper and it took a paragraph to explain it there. -- NO}

We conclude that the MAGICK dataset is indeed useful for image matting, even though it was primarily designed for image generation - resulting in a considerable domain difference between the two datasets.

        %I noticed text in figures is smaller than the main text. It's strange but do you think we can save space by putting more of the matting section into the matting figure's caption?
        %We don't have room to explain things twice. It's probably better to explain in the text. I'd consider putting all figures in one figure with no caption at all to save space. They can figure out what refers to what. This isn't ideal, but we're low on time and space.

\section{Qualitative Alpha-to-RGB Results}
In this section, we showcase many examples of Alpha-to-RGB generation, as described in \cref{sec:application_alpha_to_rgb}. 

There are many artistic applications our dataset here, such as applying styles to text.

Here are the figures we've included in this section:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Text Stylization, along with comparisons to baselines: See \cref{fig:magick_styles}% and \cref{fig:magick_styles_b} (it's split into two parts).
    \item Optical Illusions: See \cref{fig:illusions}.
    \item More variants of the letter S, continuing \cref{fig:S}: See \cref{fig:S100}.
    \item Other Results: See \cref{fig:swirly_chess}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Creation Effort}
Our dataset is comprised of both automatically selected images and manually selected images.
%
The automated part, forming 110k out of MAGICK's 150k images, involves negligible human effort. This process, as described in the paper, uses 32 A100 GPUs for three weeks, incurring only computational costs.
%
For manual section, comprising 40,000 images, we hired 5 workers who each worked 112 hours at a rate of \$0.3 USD per sample. Four of these workers were annotators, and the fifth was in charge of quality control.
%
%In future work, we plan to expand this MAGICK dataset by using these human annotations to train a classifier to automatically select the images missed by our current similarity-score-based automatic selection method (see  \cref{fig:simscores}), allowing us to create a much larger dataset without requiring manual annotation.
Human anotation requires  only one mouse click per sample.
Future work could include training a classifier model to replace the annotators.

% \todo{Please read this newly-added part}
\section{Limitations} MAGICK's main strength is its size - comprising of 150k images. However, its main limitation is that it is synthetic - inheriting both strengths and weaknesses from current diffusion models. For example, a sample with the caption ``stop sign'' will have a good alpha matte, but might spell ``stop'' incorrectly, as SDXL struggles with text.



\section{Extended Dataset Preview}
In addition to \cref{fig:datasetExpose}, which showcased 100 samples, this section presents an additional 1300 randomly selected samples from our dataset in figures \cref{fig:dataset1of4}, \cref{fig:dataset2of4}, \cref{fig:dataset3of4}, and \cref{fig:dataset4of4}.

The 1400 matted images exhibited in this document surpass the size of the previously largest general-purpose matting dataset \cite{sun2021semantic}, which contained 726 objects. Furthermore, the 1400 samples illustrated in this document represent less than 1\% of the entire MAGICK dataset, encompassing 150,000 samples, each at double the resolution of any figure depicted here.
