\section{Conclusion}
We present MAGICK, a novel dataset consisting of 150,000 generated objects with accurate alpha mattes. The dataset covers a wide variety of objects and has high quality mattes with details such as hair, fur, thin parts, and transparencies. We hope this dataset will be useful for future research, such as for training rgba generation, alpha-to-rgb, or natural image matting networks.
