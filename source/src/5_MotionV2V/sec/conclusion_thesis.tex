\section{Conclusion}

We developed a new video-to-video motion editing algorithm that allows us to edit the motion of objects, subjects and camera pose in user-provided videos. To the best of our knowledge it is the first in its class, compared to other work that control motion in the image-to-video setup. Our algorithm has a comfortable user interface, where a user drags sparse point trajectories to control objects or camera motion.
