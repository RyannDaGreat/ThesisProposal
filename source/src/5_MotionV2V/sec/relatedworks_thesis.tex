\section{Video Motion Editing}
\label{mv2v_sec:relatedworks}

\textbf{Conditional Video Generation:} Diffusion models have reshaped media generation, evolving from image synthesis~\cite{ddpm2020, stablediffusion2022} to video dynamics~\cite{vdm2022, imagenvideo2022, makeavideo2022, bar2024lumiere}, with recent text-conditioned models~\cite{cogvideox2024, wan, opensora2024} adopting transformer architectures~\cite{dit2023} for scalable denoising. Conditional video diffusion extends these by incorporating auxiliary control signals inspired by ControlNet~\cite{controlnet2023}, adapted to the temporal domain~\cite{das2025, videocontrolnet2023, motioni2v2024} for guidance through depth maps, motion vectors, and camera parameters. Video-to-video editing methods~\cite{tokenflow2024, fatezero2023, codef2024, pix2video2023, tuneavideo2023, text2videozero2023, cove2024} propagate edits across frames, often leveraging DDIM inversion~\cite{i2vedit2024, magicedit2023, stablevideo2023}. However, these are designed for local appearance changes and struggle with motion edits that disrupt structural correspondence between frames.

\textbf{Motion-Guided Video Generation:} Motion control methods divide into trajectory-based approaches~\cite{tora2024, dragnuwa2023, draganything2024, dragavideo2023, imageconductor2024, boximator2024, i2vcontrol2024, 3dtrajmaster2024, flextraj2024, freetraj2024, trailblazer2024} and optical-flow-based methods~\cite{onlyflow2024, animateanything2024} using dense correspondences from flow estimators~\cite{raft2020, tapir2023, bootstap2024, cotracker3_2024}. Despite their capabilities, these methods operate as generators rather than editors---they synthesize new videos conditioned on extracted attributes rather than modifying existing ones. Recent trajectory-based methods~\cite{motionprompt2024, gowiththeflow2025, ati} condition on single images and trajectories, but fail to preserve the visual context of existing videos when motion is modified. In contrast, our MotionV2V enables true video-to-video motion editing, allowing flexible modification of object and camera trajectories while preserving the remaining video content.
