NOTES:

Start with 

Diffusion Models Developed Rapidly - but they can't do this! (Show example) What if I want a picture of a dog that when turned upside-down turns into a sloth? 


*Breaking down barriers for artistic generation. Diffusion models broke it down for normal images, but this is much more difficult. Try finding someone that can draw an image like this!

Artists have tried to make these things in the past and now we can do it automatically. Hell, we can even do things artists have never done before! (Overlay Illusions).

In this paper, we introduce a class of constraint-based image generation algorithms that generate images through an 

We can hide images in plain sight

        Future Work: 
            Limitations: Multiplication is not a perfect simluation due to the way different inks filter light, and how empty a given toner cartridge is etc. It's not a perfect filter. We will implement printer-specific calibration during the illusoin generation process, or in post processing in a future work.
