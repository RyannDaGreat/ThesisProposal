\section{Conclusion}
\label{gwtf_sec:conclusion}

In this work, we introduce a novel and faster-than-real-time noise warping algorithm that seamlessly incorporates motion control into video diffusion noise sampling, bridging the gap between chaos and order in generative modeling. By leveraging this noise warping technique to preprocess video data for video diffusion fine-tuning, we provide a unified paradigm for a wide range of user-friendly, motion-controllable video generation applications. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of visual quality, motion controllability, and temporal consistency, making it a robust and versatile solution for motion control in video diffusion models.
