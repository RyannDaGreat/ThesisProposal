\caption{\textbf{Zero-Shot Segmentation with phrases}:  We highlight the ability of \modelname to ground complex language prompts onto an image with no segmentation specific training. An off-the-shelf diffusion model is used with only an inference time optimization technique to generate these segmentations. If you look closely, you'll notice the bald man's arms are segmented - but are not visible in the photo! Peekaboo has fairly strong shape priors.}
