    \caption{\textbf{Real-world applications}:
    Our proposed \modelname is able to localize objects of interest in the real world from arbitrary captions. We highlight how each localization successfully captures the relevant region with a clear overlap over the object centroid. This is particularly useful in applications such as robotics where interaction with arbitrary objects defined by natural language can be valuable.}
