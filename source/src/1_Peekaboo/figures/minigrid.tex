\caption{\textbf{Images generated from Stable Diffusion:} 
This data distribution is quite different from the distribution of natural images, rarely containing objects in non-central locations of the image. This bias is carried through to Peekaboo, which is why Peekaboo is best at segmenting objects near the center of an image. These images were generated by running prompts through stable diffusion v1.4, such as ``a teddy bear in times square'', and using DDPM with a guidance scale of 7. }
